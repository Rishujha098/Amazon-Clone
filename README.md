🚀 I Built an Amazon Landing Page Clone Using HTML & CSS! 🎨💻

I recently took on the challenge of recreating Amazon’s landing page using just HTML & CSS! This project helped me sharpen my front-end development skills while gaining insights into responsive design, layout structuring, and UI/UX consistency.

🔹 Key Features:
✅ Header & Navigation Bar – Designed a sticky navbar with categories, a search bar, and a cart icon.
✅ Hero Section – Styled a full-width promotional banner to mimic Amazon’s dynamic look.
✅ Product Sections – Implemented grid-based product displays similar to Amazon’s homepage layout.
✅ Footer Design – Added a structured footer with links, policies, and contact info.


💡 Tech Stack Used:
🔹 HTML5 for structuring the content
🔹 CSS3 (Flexbox & Grid) for layout and styling


🚀 What I Learned:
✅ Breaking down complex UI into reusable sections
✅ Creating a consistent and visually appealing design


👨‍💻 Next Steps: I plan to integrate JavaScript for dynamic interactions and improve user experience!
